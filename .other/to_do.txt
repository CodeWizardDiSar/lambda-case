- printing tuples:
  - (a = 1, b = 2)

    - can also close in the same line with second #
  - multiline: ## and close with second ##

- add element index mechanism
  - .<int-lit> for element
  - .change for changing
    - (i, j) = ...

- arrays

- autogenerated functions:
  - is_case: OrType -> Bool
    put in map + generate definition
  - make it clearer
