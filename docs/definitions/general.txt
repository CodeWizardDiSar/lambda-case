type_predicate definition

  (Using '_' between words for distinction from type syntax. Is it necessary??)

  type_predicate Predicate_About(A, B)_And<--C
  functions
    fun1: A -> B -> C 
    fun2: (C -> A) -> B -> A

type_proposition definition

  type_proposition Predicate_About(Int, Real)_And<--String
  proof
    fun1 = specific_fun_1
    fun2 = specific_fun_2

  here specific_fun_1 and specific_fun_2 must be defined and have the types below:
    specific_fun_1: Int -> Real -> String
    specific_fun_2: (String -> Int) -> Real -> Int

import syntax

  import 
    f1, f2, f3
      from l1
    f4, f5, f6
      from l2

Comments:

  > 4 (value_name:Type) pairs in ValueCombiner ->
    all in different line than ValueCombiner and indented more
    4 types/line
    <= 4 types in last line
  <= 4 (value_name:Type) pairs in ValueCombiner -> all in same line as ValueCombiner 

  input value_names can be "_" if they are not used is the result expression
