LowLevel:
- String Literal:
  - what type internally:
    - hard coded String?
    - ListOfChars ?
- ManyAbstractions:
  - what happens when multiple abstractions are "use_fields"?
  - currently in any conflicts only the last one is in scope

Types:
- TypeApplication chain instead of just left and right?
