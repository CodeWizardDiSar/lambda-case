# Types
## or\_type, tuple\_type
We have 2 types of types: or\_types and tuple\_types. Their behavior is
as their names suggest. Namely: 
- or\_types: these are types that can have values of different form
- tuple\_types: these are types that contain many different values (aka tuples)
# Values
## cases syntax, use\_fields syntax, let-output syntax, lambda values
# type\_predicates and type\_theorems
