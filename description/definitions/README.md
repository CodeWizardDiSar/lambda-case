# Types
## or\_type, tuple\_type
We have 2 types of types: or\_types and tuple\_types. Their behavior is
as their names suggest. Namely: 
- or\_types: many values of different form can be of the same or\_type. For example
the list type is an or\_type. It's either empty or non-empty.
- tuple\_types: values of theses types contain many different (sub)values
(aka tuples)
# Values
## cases syntax, use\_fields syntax, let-output syntax, lambda values
# type\_predicates and type\_theorems
