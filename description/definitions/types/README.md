# Types
## or\_type, tuple\_type
We have 2 types of types, or\_types and tuple\_types.
- or\_types: Many values of different form can be of the same or\_type. For
  example the list type is an or\_type. It's either empty or non-empty.
- tuple\_types: Values of these types contain many different (sub)values (aka
  tuples)
