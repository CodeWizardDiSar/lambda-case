Example:

tuple_type A, B :==> TypeName
value ( field0: Int, field1: Text, field2: A, field3: ListOf(A)s, field4: ListOf(B)s )

Comments:
- get and update functions should be generated automatically:
  - get_field0: (A, B :==> TypeName) -> Int
  - get_field1: (A, B :==> TypeName) -> Text
  - get_field2: (A, B :==> TypeName) -> A
    ...
  - update_field0: (A, B :==> TypeName), Int :> (A,B :==> TypeName)
  - update_field1: (A, B :==> TypeName), Text :> (A,B :==> TypeName)
  - update_field2: (A, B :==> TypeName), A :> (A,B :==> TypeName)
    ...
- In use_fields syntax and cases syntax we can use the fields by their name
  (cases must be on an or_type that has a tuple_type in one of the cases and the fields
  can be used in that particular case).
