type_inference

fix 
- parenthesis in one argument applications:
- cases in one argument applications:
  add one more optional application that must be right application to case??

or_type
- create new haskell type
- parser
- generator
- value syntax parse
- is_case autogenerated functions

literals
- reals
- strings

operators 
- type class maybe? 

cases
- full pattern matching

regular parenthesis function application
- parser for already existing type?

parentheses in the middle 
- function definition
- type definition
- function application

better error with Either
- transform the state with EitherT (or ExceptT for some reason)
- find error calls that are not bug errors but errors for the user and modify them 
  appropriately

tuple_type
- update_field autogenerated functions

wrong examples for testing error messages
