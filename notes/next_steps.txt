fix 
- parenthesis in one argument applications: type_inference
- matching at the end of one argument applications

or_type
- generator
- "value" default tuple_type value
- is_case autogenerated functions

literals
- reals
- strings

operators 
- type class maybe? 

cases
- full pattern matching

tuple_type
- update_field autogenerated functions

regular parenthesis function application
- parser for already existing type?

parentheses in the middle 
- function definition
- type definition
- function application

better error with Either
- transform the state with EitherT (or ExceptT for some reason)
- find error calls that are not bug errors but errors for the user and modify them 
  appropriately

wrong examples for testing error messages
