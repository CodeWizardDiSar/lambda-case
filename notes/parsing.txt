- no "try" for better error messages:
  - why is it better?
    - it tries many and gives the error message of the last one
  - to remove "try" I need to figure out the longest common prefix and parse it
    then I need to pass it to the parsers that complete the rest respectively

- <?> for better parsing error messages
- what does it do exactly?

- don't let TypeName inside paren in one_type_input_p
