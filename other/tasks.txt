- better parser errors (with less try)?
  - it fails on the last it tried
    - how to mitigate that?

- group type nicknames with "all"

--------------------------------------------------------------later

- good page changes in description pdf

- turn all args in paren func app into a tuple
  - try to typecheck with the whole tuple as the first arg
  - if it fails typecheck with the first field of the tuple as the first arg

- printing tuples (json style or similar)

- comments
  - line: #
    - can also close in the same line with second #
  - multiline: ## and close with second ##

- define arrays with power?
  - maybe good for one dimension +
    better with square brackets and commas (or x?) for multidimensional

- add element index mechanism?
  - like arrays in most languages with a[i]?
  - op like in haskell?
  - something with .change? (i, j) = ...?

- isolate hs gen (am I even gonna bother to look at the old code?)

- fix md files in github
