- change: if id from projection func need full val as arg

- param num state needs to be global?

- pattern match multiple elems in list with:
  - [x1, x2, ...=xs]
  - in Haskell: x1 : x2 : xs
 
- replace bsort.lc with the better version in the "other" dir

- remove hard coded values for or types (e.g. true=True)

- later: put try inside the parsers in the least possible prefix
