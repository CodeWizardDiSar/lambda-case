- prop names can have simple types?
  - probably only in conditions for values that use ad hoc values

- ahtv in <type-app-sub-or-id> (like in <type-app-...>)?

- simplify type-app?

- param num state needs to be global?
  - probably not

- define arrays with power?
  - maybe good for one dimension +
    better with square brackets and commas (or x?) for multidimensional

- add needs_paren to oper for prefunc app?

- isolate hs gen (am I even gonna bother to look at the old code?)
